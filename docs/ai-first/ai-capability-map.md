## Reasoning

Out of all the candidate AI capabilities, Support Chatbot and Typeahead stand out as the most impactful and beneficial. Typeahead improves conversion by helping users find products faster and reducing zero-result searches, while the Support Chatbot lowers the support contact rate by deflecting repetitive policy and order questions, this also translates into reduced support costs, since fewer live agents are needed for 24/7 coverage. Both depend only on existing data sources (FAQs, product catalog, order API), so the integration risk is low.
